# Sign Up

This folder handles both the signup and login pages. There are no other components used in either file besides images. These images include:

- The background image for the entire page
- The special Inquire logo for the top left of the sign in/up pages (this logo is in black and white since we went with a dark background)
- The normal Inquire logo in the sign in/up box
- The Google logo for the sign in/up with Google button
- The Github logo for the sign in/up with Github button

The two files contained within this folder are very similar with only small changes in messages that are displayed. Because of this, we have thought about refactoring these two files into one in the future.

The login process requires you to use third party authentication so when you click one of the buttons to choose which third party you'd like to use, the information will be sent to the backend to redirect you and get you logged in.
